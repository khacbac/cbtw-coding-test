# Welcome to your this app ðŸ‘‹

This is a GIF search application that allows users to:

- Search for GIFs using the GIPHY API
- View trending GIFs when no search term is entered
- Scroll through paginated results with infinite loading
- View GIF details and provide feedback
- Enjoy a responsive and user-friendly interface

The app is built using:

- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript for type safety
- GIPHY API for GIF content
- Custom hooks for state management and API integration
- File-based routing for navigation

Key features:

- Debounced search to optimize API calls
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Infinite scroll pagination
- Loading states and error handling
- Clean and maintainable code structure

Total Time Taken:

- 1.5 hour for the initial setup and configuration
- 1 hours for the search functionality
- 1 hour for the infinite scroll and pagination
- 1 hour for the loading states and error handling
- 1 hour for the clean and maintainable code structure

Note:

- Not all the features are implemented because we don't want to spend too much time on this demo, but the code is ready to be used for the future.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
